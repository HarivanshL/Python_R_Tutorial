    Turtorials almost over hang in there

    For this problem set were gonna go over loops

    Loops are very important in programming. It speeds up 
    automation significantly. Imagine you have to print out
    the numbers from 1 to 100. You can do this manually but
    it will take a long time. Instead you can use a loop to
    do this in a few lines of code.


    Below are some examples of loops:

# Example of a for loop
for i in range(1, 101):
    print(i)

# Example of a while loop
i = 1
while i <= 100:
    print(i)
    i += 1

    

# Example of a nested loop
for i in range(1, 11):
    for j in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{i} * {j} = {i * j}")


You can keep nesting loops but it significantly decreases performance
by multiple orders of magnitude. So be careful when using nested loops
