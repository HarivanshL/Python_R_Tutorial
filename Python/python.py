    Purpose: Provide a turtorial in python for Madihah and Sumi


    The triple quotations mark this paragraph is imbedded in is a multiline string in python. 
    You will see it often in this document. Read these because it will provide an explanation, 
    resources, or instructions. These are also often used in programs to simulate comments

    It is a good idea to always provide some form of comments or documentation when programming.
    That way when someone reads your code in the future (you or anyone else) you can understand 
    what each piece of the program does. This also helps you to debug your progrm and see where 
    things went wrong. Feel free to use them yourself

    
    Start with the python files in this directory labeled "problem_#.py" where # is the number of the problem.

    If you get lost or confused, feel free to ask me for help. I am here to help you learn and understand.
    You can also use Youtube, Google, and AI. This is all to help you understand how things work. AI is a 
    great resource. Try to refrain from using it to generate code and more towards explaining concepts 
    because understanding how it works is way more useful.

    Do the problems then come back to this for more resouces


    Lets begin!!

#This is also a comment but only goes onto one line



"""
    There is a lot you can do with python, from statistics to machine learning to web development.
    
    In the future if you want to continue with this I highly recommend looking into the following:
    Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib,
    Pandas- A data manipulation library that is very powerful and useful for data analysis
    Numpy- A numerical computing library that is very fast and efficient for numerical operations
    Matplotlib- A plotting library that is very useful for plotting data

    You guys can use these in your jobs. This turtorial is just to give you a basic start to python
    Remember, library documentation is very useful. You can find it on the internet. Just google the library
    or ask me or AI.
