# Getting Started

## Python

### Go through the python files first.
### Read python.py then proceed
### You will need an IDE. I suggest downloading [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
### Then open your IDE and work on the python files


## R

### Go through these files after python unless you feel comfortable with python
### Start off with reading the html document (it should open in your browser when double clicked)
### This tutorial is not too in depth, just showcasing some things you can do with R


# Finishing up

## Getting Help

### Feel free to ask me, use AI, google, youtube, and documentation

### There is so much you can do with python and R please do not be discouraged if things are not working right
### I cannot tell you how many times there have been minor mistakes that have held me back

## Hope this tutorial was helpful and you enjoyed these practice problems
