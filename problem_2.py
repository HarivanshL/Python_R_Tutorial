    Control statements:


    Control statements are very useful to determine what to do next
    Imagine youre in a car and you have to decide if you should turn left or right
    or if you should stop or go. Control statements are like the steering wheel of the car
    that helps you to decide what to do next.


    Below are some function with practice problems you will implement

    I have completed the first problem so you get an idea


Examples of control statements:

1. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else):
    Example:
    if x > 0:
         print("Positive")
    elif x < 0:
         print("Negative")
    else:
         print("Zero")

2. Looping Statements (for, while):
    Example:
    for i in range(5):
         print(i)

    Example:
    while x < 5:
         print(x)
         x += 1

3. Control Flow Statements (break, continue, pass):
    Example:
    for i in range(10):
         if i == 5:
              break
         print(i)

    Example:
    for i in range(10):
         if i % 2 == 0:
              continue
         print(i)

    Example:
    for i in range(10):
         if i % 2 == 0:
              pass
         else:
              print(i)
